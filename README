This package requires one more library, in addition to the files shipped with
the program: Tim Henderson's Zhang-Shasha library, available at
https://github.com/timtadh/zhang-shasha (known to work with revision cb1f777).

SYNOPSIS:
    syn-agreement.py [--tree|--conll] [--acc] [--metric=plain|diff|norm|all] fileA fileB
    syn-agreement.py [--tree|--conll] [--acc] [--metric=plain|diff|norm|all] --dirs dir...

DESCRIPTION:
    --tree
        Read phrase structure trees instead of dependency trees. The phrase
        structure format is slightly idiosyncratic. See the section "Phrase
        structure format" below for details.

    --conll
        Read CoNLL formatted dependency trees. This is the default.

    --acc
        Compute uncorrected accuracies in addition to alpha score. For
        dependency trees, UAS, LAS and label accuracy is computed, and for
        phrase structure trees Jaccard similarity is computed.

    --metric=plain|diff|norm|all
        Select the metric to use, or compute all metrics at the same time. The
        default metric is the plain metric.

        NOTE: For any use beyond the reproduction of the results presented in
        Skjærholt (2014) we discourage the use of any other metric that
        α_plain.

    --dirs
        Enable multi-annotator mode. In cases where there are more than two
        annotators, it is common that not all annotators have annotated all of
        the texts. Therefore, we use a mode of operation where each
        annotator's output is in a separate directory. Sentences from files
        with matching names will be grouped together to account for missing
        annotations.

        The file and directory structure must follow the following convention:
        We assume the basename of the directory path to be the "name" of the
        annotator, and the files within to be named thusly:
        $prefix-$name.conll (or $prefix-$name.tree for constituency trees),
        where files with the same prefix in different directories are assumed
        to contain *exactly* the same sentences.

        If the --acc option is also passed, pairwise accuracies are computed.

PHRASE STRUCTURE FORMAT:
    Assume we have the following tree for the sentence "I saw the dog":
                       S
                       ^
                      / \
                     /   VP
                    |     ^
                    |    / \
                    |   /   NP
                   NP  |     ^
                    |  |    / \
                    P  V   D   N
                    |  |   |   |
                    I saw the dog

    The program then expects the tree to be stored *delexicalised* as follows:
        (S (NP P) (VP V (NP D N)))
